Pheasant
=====================

Pheasant is a simple object mapper for PHP 5.3+ and MySQL 5+. It offers basic relationships and query hydration.

Why?
----

Pheasant is designed to be light and fast. It doesn't provide database abstraction and only supports a basic set
of relationships. Magic doesn't scale, neither do giant codebases. Pheasant aims to make pragmatic compromises 
and not try and do everything. More than 5,000 lines is too much! 

Usage
-----

{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}


Project Status
--------------

Pheasant is still very much alpha, as far as I know it's not being used in production.
